# TODO List

## Platform Specifications

### Remove platform specification from tests when base image supports ARM64

**Files affected:**
- `tests/docker-build-test.sh` (line ~47)
- `tests/docker-compose.test.yml` (line ~70)

**Description:**
Currently, we explicitly specify `--platform linux/amd64` in tests because the devpanel/php base image is not available for linux/arm64. Once the base image supports ARM64:

1. Remove `--platform linux/amd64` from the docker build command in `tests/docker-build-test.sh`
2. Remove `platform: linux/amd64` from the deployment service in `tests/docker-compose.test.yml`

This will allow tests to run natively on any architecture without forcing a specific platform.

**Tracking:**
- Related to devpanel/php base image ARM64 support
- Test on ARM64 systems after removing to ensure compatibility
